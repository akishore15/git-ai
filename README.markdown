Welcome to the gitai repo! This gitai is a AI made from the 6 coding languages that are described; Java, Shell, Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Please note I am in no way affiliated for any AI companies. This was just a fun project to see that we can all make an AI simply. It's as easy as you just making a bowl of cereal. This is also to inspire people to make their own AIs and be creative with it. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at "kiaravind15@proton.me" for support.
